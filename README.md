# Gross Motor Keyboard
The plan for this is to convert any keyboard into one that can be used by folks who don't have fine motor skills and therefore can't peck a specific key. Since speech loss often accompanies fine motor skill loss and since speech to text is so good now, I'm working with the assumption that the user has lost his or her speech as well. Whether this is useful or not remains to be seen. 

## How it works
The keyboard acts like a touch screen in that it detects taps and swipes based on the general direction keys are hit. The left andright side of the keyboard can detect a tap, swipe up, swipe right, swipe down, and swipe left. This adds up to 10 different "keys." There is an interface (very crude right now) which lets the user navigate to the right character in 3 motions or less.

## Roadmap
* Make interface better
* Refactor code
* Get folks with expertise or folks lacking fine motor skills to test/look at it.
* Expand on the symbols available.
* Make backspace key a lot better.
* Make a video demonstration.
* A lot more!
